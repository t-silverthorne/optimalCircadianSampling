Narrative 1: Accuracy of parameter estimates
(1) Derive the expected FIM. Improvement of non-uniform over uniform depending on choice of prior
(2) Check convergence rate. 
	- Analyze data, update prior
	- Optional: Use new prior to optimize non-uniform sampling ( ta, tb )
	- Generate new data
If possible: apply to real data. Maybe birhythmicity in p53-mdm2 module

Narrative 2: minimizers of functional
- something about the annals paper

Narrative 3: Spectral reconstruction
- read non-unfirom Shannon theory paper 

Narrative 4: Statistical significance
- permutation vs false alarm rates 
-

- Want to estimate periods from data, assume biharmonic.
- Show that sampling rate matters
- Try to explain using OED
	- Experimental design is a measure
	- determinant of the FIM measures quality of design
	- fails to capture obvious performance difference
